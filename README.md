This app is a sliding puzzle in Android Studio

There are two 3x3 boards in the puzzle. 

The initial board is filled with numbers from 1 to 8 in some random order and one slot is blank. 

The goal board is sorted and the blank slot is at the end. 

The goal is to start at the initial board, swap the values repeatedly, and to reach the goal board. 

Only the blank slot and one of its neighbors can be swapped at a time.
